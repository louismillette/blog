                <p class="wow fadeInUp delay-04s">I'm a student graduating from the University of Waterloo (Waterloo Ontario) in the winter of 2018, with a statistics degree from the department of mathematics.  Beyond the statistical modeling, R, MATLAB, and Stata I've learned in school, I taught myself Django, AWS, SciPy, Numpy, Python(especially), c and c++, HTML CSS JS+jquery, SQL, postgres, excel, and I’ve even wrote a couple of macros.  I try to visualize my projects extensively using plotly, highcharts, ggplot2 and loon; as well as some other HTML/JS stuff.  Click on any of the platforms below for my related experience.</p>

                        <p> I've built multiple web apps in the Django framework, mostly small ones hosted on AWS.  Django is not taught at the university of waterloo, even in the CS department.</p>

It is built in Django/postgres, and hosted on AWS (EC2/EBS + RDS).  Over the years I added some metrics on the data I gathered, and put it into a dashboard. </li>

Hosted on AWS (EC2/EBS + RDS) with Django and postgres, I used python3.6 + tensor flow + keras/SciPy to build a machine learning model to categorize Facebook posts.  </li>

                        <p> Most of my web apps are hosted on AWS EC2/EBS instances, and use an RDS instance for the database.  I also dabble in lambda instances, when they feel more appropriate.  This is the kind of skill they don't teach at school, CS degree or not. </p>

                            <li><a href="Calculator/"  target="_blank"><b>Financial Calculator: </a></b> My financial calculator uses a little bit of corporate finance and some python to generate real world financial possibilities.  Mainly, it answers the question "If I invested x amount of money, adjusted for inflation each year, for y years in fund z, how much money would I have?"  After adjusting for inflation, taxes (federal, state, provincial) , dividends, taxes on dividends, compound returns, this problem is more complicated then you might imagine.  The code is hosted on AWS (lambda), the visuals are generated with the help of highcharts.</a>

                        <p> my SciPy experience is mostly centered around combinatorial optimization and modeling and machine learning.  While SciPy is not taught at the university of Waterloo, some stat courses (the machine learning one) assume you have taught yourself by the time you take the course.</p>

I used a <a href="https://louismillette.github.io/Investement-Calulator/#compound-multiplier-optimizer">similar model</a> to the CAPM, adjusting investment strategy to lower risk with age and optimizing with a Bashin-Hop algorithm instead of LaGrange multiplier; to account for the additional complexity of the model including tax, dividends, etc.  I used the SciPy-python framework to implement the model, python + numpy to build the compound multiplier, and plotly to visualize it all with heatmaps, bar plots, and the gamma distribution overlay.   </li>

I would've added a link but I was the only one who used git (group projects am I right?)  We built a classifier using the <a href="https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">LightGBM</a> algorithm (decision tree + boosting), and pythons very fast H5 storage.  Ended up getting a 73 on the project, not too bad. </li>

                <h3>Work Experience</h3>

                <p>I've endured 3 internships, one at Astute Solutions CRM firm.  I spent half my time building the unit tests for their .NET stack (and working with their bamboo server for integrated testing), and the second half building widgets that took data from their SQL DB, and made fancy high charts out of them.  Learned some C# coding standards, and worked with SQL database in a .NET framework.</p>

                <p>I did another internship in Toronto working at Seed Sustainable, as a software engineer.  I built their user authentication program in Django, setting up user log-ins, authentication, and sign up token system.  I spent another part of it making all sorts of highcharts for various data sets my boss had.  I spent the last third of my 4 months there building a real time server to scrape data from the Zach’s and Reuters apply data filters, and categorize in a postgres data base.  I received a letter of recommendation from my bass at Seed Sustainable, which I would be happy to provide upon request</p>

                <p>In 2013, I spend a couple months interning at the federal reserve bank of Cleveland, under their research department.  The experience was interesting, they built economic models in stata, . </p>

                <h3>Projects</h3>

                <p>My projects are a true indicator of my skill.  Unfortunately, I got to GitHub a little bit late.  I was using bitbucket for large projects for a couple years, and mostly just keeping my projects locally.  I'm moving old projects online, and trying to create and maintain current one's, but the process is lengthy.  My upload projects are available <a href="https://github.com/louismillette">here.</a></p>
